### What is Tuberculosis (TB)? ü§î
Tuberculosis (TB) is a **serious airborne infectious disease** caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. 
While it primarily affects the **lungs**, it can also impact other organs like the **kidneys**, **brain**, and **spine**. 

### Global Impact of TB:
- In 2022, **10.6 million** people were infected globally, leading to **1.3 million deaths**.
- In 2023, **Malaysia** alone recorded **26,781 cases**, a **5.47% increase** from the previous year.

TB is both preventable and treatable, but challenges such as **drug resistance** and **treatment non-compliance** persist.

# How TB Spreads Section
st.markdown("""
---
## How Does TB Spread? üå¨Ô∏è

TB spreads through **airborne droplets** expelled when an infected person **coughs**, **sneezes**, or **talks**. 
Close and prolonged exposure to an infected individual increases the risk of transmission.

### Key Risk Factors:
- Living in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces.
- Co-existing conditions like **HIV** or **diabetes**.
- Lack of access to timely healthcare.

# Challenges in TB Treatment Section

## Challenges in TB Treatment üè•

The standard treatment for TB includes a **6-month regimen**:
1. **2-month intensive phase** with multiple antibiotics.
2. **4-month continuation phase** for eradicating remaining bacteria.

However, **not all patients respond the same** to this approach, leading to:
- **Drug resistance** requiring complex and toxic regimens.
- **Treatment failures** due to non-compliance or comorbidities.
            
#### Need for Personalized Care:
By leveraging **AI models**, healthcare providers can tailor treatment plans to individual patient needs, improving outcomes.

## Importance of Explainable AI in TB Treatment üîç

### What is Explainable AI (XAI)?
XAI enhances the transparency of **machine learning models** by explaining how **specific factors influence predictions**. This ensures:
- Trust among clinicians and patients.
- Informed decisions for better treatment strategies.

For example, **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** can help identify which patient features (e.g., age, comorbidities) impact their treatment duration or outcome predictions.

### Learn More About SHAP:
To delve deeper into **SHAP interpretations and calculations**, navigate to the **sidebar** and select **"What is SHAP (XAI)"**. This section provides an overview of SHAP‚Äôs functionality and its role in making machine learning models explainable.
